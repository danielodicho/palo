GranolaAI: \n\nI use this AI note-taker for all my personal meetings. \n\nTaking notes during coffee chats / informational interviews takes away from the actual conversation, so using a notetaker like this will save a ton of time. Highly recommend. Here's a link: https://lnkd.in/gf-RpMtD\n\n\nBonus: Simplify\nBrowse non-scammy jobs, autofill your applications, generate AI resumes and cover letters, track your applications.

(Yay!)\n\nLike many of my peers in the May 2025 college graduate cohort, I'm officially starting what will no doubt be a months-long search to secure a full-time position after graduating with my Bachelor's degree in May.\n\nI'll admit, it's extremely daunting knowing the journey that's ahead. I know I'll repeatedly experience feelings of self-doubt and imposter syndrome. However, I know I\u2019m not alone in navigating a challenging job market, especially in competitive fields like tech, finance, and project management.\n\nSo, why is my first post since 2023 about submitting my first full-time job application? Well, on top of fulfilling a personal goal of being more proactive with my overall health (mentally, socially, and physically), I wanted to take the first step by actually starting. By embracing an optimistic mindset, I can stay focused and motivated while overcoming feelings of burnout and discouragement.\n\nI've set a goal for myself to submit one application every day. One application a day, each with a tailored resume and cover letter. I make sure to thoroughly research the role beforehand, ensuring it\u2019s a good fit. And, of course, I make sure to keep track using a spreadsheet. :)\n\nI'm extremely grateful for the support and guidance I've received thus far from my connections, friends, professors, and even my fellow LinkedIn peers. Reading about or hearing your stories helps keep me grounded, reminding me that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to finding fulfillment in any field or interest.\n\nWishing the best to all of us looking for our next opportunities. I'm excited to see what doors will be open to you in 2025!\n\n---------\nInspired by Angela Richard, M.Ed.'s post, who provided some tips on how to remain focused and positive during the process.\n\nAdditional thanks to Michael Yan and the team at Simplify. It's incredible seeing Simplify's growth since I first discovered the platform in 2023 via Instagram. I cannot emphasize enough how invaluable this resource has been for every single role I've applied to and later accepted. You guys are seriously the best, and I can't wait to see where you go from here!"}]}]}

But I had to choose between submitting 10 good applications a day and 3-4 great ones. In this market, and with the financial clock ticking, I had to choose the 10. Until I didn't.\n\n-Simplify used AI to tailor my existing resume based on keywords found in each individual job posting. (Take that, arbitrary applicant-tracking systems!) \n\n-It helped me generate similarly keyword-rich cover letters that I could then personalize. (You don't have to, but 100% AI-generated content is painful, obvious, and painfully obvious.) \n\n-It also suggested job openings for me based on some extremely selective parameters. (I'm picky!)\n\nBonus: it cost 40 bucks for a 3-month subscription (the length of the average job search), and I got hired well before the subscription ended. The peace of mind alone was worth the cost, knowing that some fickle robot wouldn't reject me out of hand because I said \"copywriting\" instead of \"copy writing\". \n\nSo, for all my friends newly on the job hunt, save yourself some time and elbow grease.

Eventually, John mortgaged his mother's house for $100,000 in startup capital. After struggling to make his idea work, things finally clicked when his neighbor, a rapper named LL Cool J, agreed to wear FUBU in a music video. \n\nThat kickstarted the hype, which has now led to a $6 billion brand.\u00a0\nDespite his success, I\u2019m inspired by John\u2019s commitment to give back to his community. \n\nNot only did FUBU play a major role in empowering the Black community and create dozens of jobs, he\u2019s also leveraged his success in other ways to give back.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nIn 2015, he launched the Black Entrepreneurs Day, a free global livestream giving guidance and grants to aspiring Black business owners. He's also an advocate for financial literacy in underserved communities.\n\nIn his \"Success Formula\" program, John has mentored thousands of young entrepreneurs, with a particular focus on nurturing talent in urban areas. He even frequently returns to his old neighborhood in Hollis, Queens, to speak at schools and community centers.\n\nOn Shark Tank, John is often the first to invest in Black-owned businesses and champions those founders. \n\nTruth is, he doesn\u2019t need to do all this. \n\nBut it\u2019s inspiring that he\u2019s choosing to. \n\nChoosing to become a beacon of possibility for Black youth, proving that with hustle and determination, anyone can achieve their dreams.\n\nJohn\u2019s dedication to uplifting his community reminds me that true success isn't just about personal wealth\u2014it's also about creating opportunities for others. \n\nHappy Juneteenth everybody :)\n\u2014\n\nEnjoy stories like these?\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Feel free to repost it to your network!"}]}]}

At $40 per box, they sold out, netting $30,000. \n\nThis wasn't just cash; it was runway to keep Airbnb alive. As Chesky puts it, \"It literally saved our company.\"\n\nThat cereal money carried them to 2009, when they finally secured funding. From there, Airbnb exploded.

Having 'strong connections' is paramount to get your foot inside the door. Otherwise, you are simply a number of many applicants that may never get seen.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 - Lots of automation. I have received a few denials thus far with no human interaction. I admire the companies that actually have an individual that replies, however, when you ask that individual for specific feedback, my response rate from those is 0%. What does that mean? Does it mean it's automated as well, or, am I missing something here?\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 - Tailoring is key, right? Well, let's discuss that. I have tailored my resume to each of the companies I have applied to. Meaning, I have ensured that my resume properly aligns to what the role is looking for. I still get the rejection notice that they are pursuing candidates that align better with the role. Hmm, strange.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 - Uniqueness: I have tried LinkedIn premium messaging, customized emails, videos, and mailed hand-written notes with no response.\n\nAny #recruiters out there willing to have a conversation with me to give me some guidance and feedback? Thanks in advance to all that comment to this post and share ideas and feedback with me. I welcome and can appreciate any and all guidance here during these challenging times. \n\nAlso, hats off to the team over at Simplify, their product helps make keeping track of the application process simple.\n\n#opentowork #jobsearch #salesjobs #softwarejobs"}]}]}

Include your personal insights and experiences as a child of Asian immigrants.

This stereotype of being hard-working perfectionists, unwilling to take big risks, stems from the immigrant scarcity mindset. \n\nGrowing up the child of Asian immigrants can be both a blessing and a curse. We are raised with a hard work ethic and a focus on excellence, but also with a scarcity mindset and fear of failure. Although Asian Americans are the least likely to be promoted to executive ranks because of the bamboo ceiling, we must also take responsibility for the ways we hold ourselves small. Despite what we were raised to believe, hard work and strong performance are not enough to succeed. This is why we are often seen as workhorses, and not racehorses in the workplace. No one invests in their workhorses, because there is no future upside for them. But racehorses are nurtured and well-cared for, because they can yield great rewards. \n\nA scarcity mindset believes that there are finite resources and is focused on what you don\u2019t have. An abundance mindset believes that you can grow the pie for everyone instead of believing everything is a zero-sum game. When you are constantly in self-preservation and survival mode, it is hard to see the bigger picture. You are always playing it safe and afraid to take risks or bet on yourself, because you are fixated on the cost and what you might lose. You also refuse to help others, because you are afraid that there won\u2019t be enough for yourself. A scarcity mindset is always playing defense. But you can only lose or at best tie a game by only playing defense. You can only win by going on the offensive and putting points on the board. \n\nYou have to be willing to take risks and that means making mistakes and ultimately failing sometimes. Many immigrants from Asia come from countries where entrance exams determine your future. Every mistake you make is costly. When you are raised to believe that anything less than 100% is unacceptable, you are programmed to fear taking risks and failing. In America, you don\u2019t need to be 100% certain to be confident. Guessing and being wrong is okay. You learn from your mistakes and failures and you become more resilient because you recover from them. You don\u2019t need to be perfect to be successful. We were conservatively raised to color within the lines, so as not to stand out. No one gets noticed for coloring in the lines. No one gets a promotion for doing the status quo. Taking risks by being unconventional and thinking outside the box is what gets recognized. Remember that you belong in the rooms you are in, so start acting like it.\n\nI wrote about all of this and how we can overcome these hurdles, in my latest essay.
